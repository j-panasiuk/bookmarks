## Browser bookmark viewer
### A project for personal use, currently WIP

Making the repo public now to keep the development process transparent, for anyone curious :)

Features:
- Remix + Typescript + NodeJS application
- Upload your bookmarks, as exported by the browser (an .html file)
- Parse bookmark file into a predictable tree structure
- Search through bookmarks, folders
- Select and export lists of bookmarks links (useful as an input to other applications...)
- More to come...
